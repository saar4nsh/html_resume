           <li><h3>Post-Pandemic Credit Card Introduction in Indian Market Analysis and A/B Testing Approach</h3>
            Individual Project
           <ul>
               <li>The project aimed to launch a credit card in post-COVID India for a hypothetical bank.</li>
               <li>Phase 1 involved cleaning and analyzing data to identify target customer segments.</li>
               <li>Phase 2 we used A/B Testing approach on two groups (test group and control group) to test the credibility of our new credit
                card.

           <li><h3>Risc-V Assembler and Branch Predictor Simulator</h3>
            Course - Computer Architecture // Faculty - Dr TV Kalyan and Dr Neeraj Goyal
           <ul>
               <li>Collaboratively developed a 32-bit RISC-V assembler in C++ to convert assembly code (.asm) to machine code (.mc),
                maintaining proper segment formats.</li>
               <li>Utilized Git for version control and team synchronization, with comprehensive monitoring of code updates and repository
                activity</li>
               <li>In extension to this developed a RISC-V branch predictor simulation in C++
                </li>
                <li>Incorporated dynamic instruction trace handling with improved branch prediction methods (Always taken, Always nottaken, 1-bit, and 2-bit dynamic predictors).</li>
                <li>Achieved high accuracy in branch prediction, effectively maintaining a branch target buffer and history table for enhanced
                    performance analysis.
